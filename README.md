### Directory Structure
Here is the core directory structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the directory structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- data/
|- domain/
|- presentation/
|- shared/
|- main.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib directory which has the main code for the application.

```
1 - data - Contains the data layer of project, includes directories for local, network and shared pref/cache.
2 - domain - Contains abstraction and business logic of project, includes models, responses, request, etc.
3 - presentation - Contains all the ui of project, contains sub directory for each screen.
4 - shared - Contains the utilities/common functions, styles of application.
5 - main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title etc.
```

### Main
This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title etc.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'package:overlay_support/overlay_support.dart';
import 'package:todo_app/presentation/bindings/global_binding.dart';
import 'package:todo_app/presentation/router/router.dart';
import 'package:todo_app/presentation/router/routes.dart';
import 'package:todo_app/shared/constants/app_values.dart';
import 'package:todo_app/shared/core/localization/keys.dart';
import 'package:todo_app/shared/core/localization/translations.dart';
import 'package:todo_app/shared/styles/themes.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(const ToDoApp());
}

class ToDoApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const ToDoApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OverlaySupport.global(
      child: GetMaterialApp(
        navigatorKey: Get.key,
        getPages: AppRouter.routes,
        initialRoute: AppRoutes.splash,
        title: StringsKeys.todo.tr,
        initialBinding: GlobalBinding(),
        translations: AppTranslations(),
        locale: const Locale(AppValues.lcEN),
        theme: AppThemes.getTheme(),
        debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
